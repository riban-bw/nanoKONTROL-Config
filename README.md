This tool provides a graphical user interface allowing configuration of Korg nanoKONTROL1 and nanoKONTROL2 devices. Functionality is broadly similar to Korg's own configuration tool (which I have never seen!). This tool is cross platform and open source.

MIDI connection is via JACK or ALSA (or both) hence a working JACK service and/or ALSA driver must be running before starting the application. It detects new MIDI ports so the device may be connected after starting the application.

# Installation

For Debian/Ubuntu systems:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-tk python3-pil python3-pil.imagetk
pip install tk
```

# Usage

Start the application with:

    python3 nanoKONTROL.py

After starting the application, select the MIDI ports to which the nanoKONTROL is connected using the drop-down lists near the top, labelled "MIDI input" and "MIDI output". This is likely to be "nanoKONTROL" or "nanoKONTROL2" unless the device is connected to another machine and MIDI routed. The picture of the device should change to to indicate the device detected.

Click on a button, slider or knob on the image and adjust its parameters using the editor on the right hand side.

# Dependancies

The application is written in Python3 and tested on GNU/Linux. It should run on any platform that can meet the following dependancies:

- jack (for JACK MIDI interface)
- alsa-midi (for ALSA MIDI interface)
- tkinter
- PIL
- PIL Image

On a DEBIAN based system the following may install the required Python modules:

`sudo apt install python3-jack-client python3-tk python3-pil python3-pil.imagetk`

To install alsa-midi:

```
sudo apt install python3-pip
sudo pip3 install alsa-midi
```

On Windows 10 I found I could run the application after installing Python modules: Pillow and jack-client and installing and starting JACK. (The application crashes when trying to import jack if the JACK service is not running.)

```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip3 install Pillow
pip3 install jack-client
```

Jack can be installed from: https://jackaudio.org/downloads. Configuring with "Dummy" audio driver may get it going quickly, e.g. if a supported soundcard is not installed. Adding "-Xwinmme" to the "Advanced" sub-tab of "Settings" tab in QjackCtrl added USB MIDI device to jack graph. I found this added two inputs and four outputs. The second input worked. Not sure about output (poor quality USB MIDI interface available for this test).
